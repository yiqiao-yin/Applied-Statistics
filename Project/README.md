# README

This is the folder for project. I apologize upfront because the current project is related to a recent submission which is currently under review. However, in order to serve as part of the supplement, we made some simulated code available and open source here. Thank you for your understanding.

## Simulation

In this small simulation, let us examine the following model.

## Shiny App

To enable a user-friendly environment, we post this app that was initially developed by Jon Auerbach. Dr. Auerbach has graduated from the Department of Statistics. He designed the feature selection portion of the app. Later on, I upgraded the app by introducing the separation of training and testing set. We report test set porformance and the difference of the proposed methodology and tree-based algorithms. We use this app to illustrate the usage of the proposed methodology I-score.

### User Manual

#### Input

First, let us introduce the input parameters:
- sample size:
- number of times to run backward dropping algorithm:
- number of modules to report:
- number of bootstrap samples for bias: 
- seed:
- variables for module 1:
- variables for module 2:
